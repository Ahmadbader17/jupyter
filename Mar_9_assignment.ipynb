    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means from any population approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In other words, if we take multiple samples from a population and calculate their means, the distribution of those means will be approximately normal, even if the original population is not normally distributed.\n",

    "1) Provides a basis for hypothesis testing: The CLT enables the use of inferential statistics to test hypotheses about population means, variances, and proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Allows for the use of parametric tests: Many statistical tests and techniques rely on the assumption of normality. The CLT enables the use of such tests by providing a way to approximate the normal distribution for sample means.\n",
