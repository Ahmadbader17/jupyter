    "An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron or a set of neurons in a neural network. It introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn and represent complex relationships between the input and output variables.\n"

    "Some common types of activation functions used in neural networks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Sigmoid function (Logistic function): It squashes the input into a range between 0 and 1, representing the neuron's output probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function: Similar to the sigmoid function, but it squashes the input into a range between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): It returns the input if it is positive, otherwise, it returns zero. It is one of the most popular activation functions due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Leaky ReLU: Similar to ReLU, but it allows a small non-zero gradient when the input is negative, addressing the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Softmax function: It converts a vector of real values into a probability distribution, often used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems."

    "Activation functions have a significant impact on the training process and performance of a neural network. Here are some effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Non-linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling neural networks to learn complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Gradient propagation: Activation functions affect how gradients flow during backpropagation, which is the process of updating the network's weights. The choice of activation function can impact the stability and speed of convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Output range: The range of values an activation function produces can affect the dynamics and behavior of the network. For example, sigmoid functions confine outputs to a specific range, while ReLU functions allow more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Vanishing and exploding gradients: Certain activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh, can suffer from vanishing gradients, making it difficult for deep networks to learn. Choosing activation functions like ReLU can mitigate this issue.\n"

    "The rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). It returns the input if it is positive, and zero otherwise. Here's how it differs from the sigmoid function:\n",

    "Range: ReLU produces an output of zero for negative inputs and directly passes through positive inputs, making it unbounded in the positive range.\n",

    "Leaky ReLU is a variation of the ReLU activation function that addresses the issue of \"dead neurons\" or neurons that become unresponsive and output zero for all inputs. It introduces a small slope for negative inputs, allowing a small non-zero output. The leaky ReLU function is defined as f(x) = max(αx, x), where α is a small positive constant (typically around 0.01).\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing a small negative slope, leaky ReLU prevents neurons from completely dying and enables the flow of gradients for negative inputs during backpropagation. This helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem associated with ReLU and encourages the activation of previously inactive neurons, leading to improved learning in deep neural networks."
