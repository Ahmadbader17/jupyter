    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning algorithm used for regression problems. It is an ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictor. The algorithm works by iteratively fitting a new decision tree to the residuals of the previous tree, gradually reducing the error until the model converges."

    "In Gradient Boosting, a weak learner is a model that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In practice, weak learners are typically simple decision trees with few nodes, low depth, and high bias. The idea behind Gradient Boosting is to iteratively add these weak learners to the ensemble and adjust their weights to reduce the errors of the previous learners. The final model is a combination of all the weak learners, weighted by their contribution to the overall prediction. By combining multiple weak learners, Gradient Boosting can create a strong learner that performs well on the data."

    "The intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm is to iteratively add weak learners to the model, with each subsequent learner correcting the errors of the previous ones. This is achieved by minimizing a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The algorithm uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function, which involves calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to the predictions of the current model. This gradient is then used to update the model parameters, so that the next weak learner can be trained on the residual errors of the previous model."

    "The Gradient Boosting algorithm builds an ensemble of weak learners by iteratively adding them to the model, with each subsequent learner correcting the errors of the previous ones. The algorithm starts by fitting a simple model to the data, typically a decision tree with only a few nodes.
