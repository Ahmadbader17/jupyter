    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical concept that describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge or experience. It is used to update our beliefs or knowledge about an event based on new evidence or information. Bayes' theorem is named after the 18th-century mathematician and philosopher Thomas Bayes."

    "Bayes' theorem is used in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data analysis. In practice, Bayes' theorem is used to update our prior beliefs or knowledge about an event based on new evidence or data. It is used in Bayesian inference to estimate unknown parameters in statistical models, in medical diagnosis to determine the probability of a disease given certain symptoms, in spam filtering to classify emails as spam or not spam, and in many other applications."

    "Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events. It provides a way to update our prior beliefs or knowledge about an event based on new evidence or data. The theorem involves multiplying the prior probability of an event by the likelihood of observing the evidence given the event, and then dividing by the prior probability of the evidence.\n",

    "Naive Bayes is a family of classifiers that are based on Bayes' theorem and assume that the features are conditionally independent given the class. There are three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data being analyzed. Gaussian Naive Bayes is typically used for continuous data, Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for discrete data such as text, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes is used for binary data. However, it is important to note that the choice of classifier can also be influenced by factors such as the size of the dataset, the number of features, and the level of sparsity."

    "To classify the new instance, we need to calculate the probability of it belonging to each class, given the feature values X1 = 3 and X2 = 4.\n",
