    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by using multiple decision trees and combining their predictions. Each decision tree is trained on a subset of the data and a random subset of features. By using multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions, the model is less likely to overfit the training data and generalize better to new data.\n",

    "The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor uses multiple decision trees, while Decision Tree Regressor uses only one decision tree. Random Forest Regressor is less likely to overfit and provides more accurate predictions than Decision Tree Regressor."
