    "Weights and biases play a crucial role in forward propagation. The weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons and control the contribution of each input to the next layer. Biases provide an additional learnable parameter that allows the activation function to be shifted, affecting the overall output of a neuron. During forward propagation, the weights and biases are used to compute the weighted sum of inputs and to adjust the output through the activation function, ultimately producing the network's output.\n",

    "Some common challenges or issues that can occur during backward propagation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Vanishing or exploding gradients: When the gradients become very small or very large as they propagate backward, it can hinder the learning process. This issue can be addressed by using activation functions that mitigate gradient-related problems, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), or by using techniques like gradient clipping or normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Choice of activation functions: Different activation functions have different properties and may be more suitable for different types of problems. Choosing an inappropriate activation function can lead to suboptimal performance or learning difficulties. It is important to select activation functions that are appropriate for the problem at hand and the characteristics of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Overfitting: Backward propagation can potentially lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping, can be employed to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Initialization: Initializing the weights and biases in an appropriate manner is crucial for effective backward propagation. Poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or getting stuck in local optima. Techniques like Xavier or He initialization can be used to set the initial values of weights to appropriate scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Computational efficiency: Backward propagation involves calculating gradients for each weight and bias in the network, which can be computationally expensive, especially in large-scale networks. Various optimization techniques, like mini-batch training, parallelization, or hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs), can be employed to improve the computational efficiency.\n",
