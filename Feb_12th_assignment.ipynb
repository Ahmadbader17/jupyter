    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception which is a special object that represents the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of exceptions in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "SyntaxError: Raised when there is an error in the syntax of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "ValueError: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "NameError: Raised when a local or global name is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError: Raised when an index is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError: Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "AttributeError: Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when there is a problem with the code itself, while exceptions occur during the execution of the code. Exceptions can occur even if the code is syntactically correct, but there is a problem with the logic or data being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between exceptions and syntax errors is how they are handled. Syntax errors must be fixed by changing the code, while exceptions can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms such as try-except blocks. In this way, exceptions provide a way for a program to gracefully handle errors and continue executing, rather than simply crashing."

    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it will result in the program terminating abruptly and displaying an error message that describes the exception. This can cause unexpected behavior and can make it difficult to determine the cause of the error.\n",

    "In this example, the program tries to print the value of a variable called my_variable. However, my_variable is not defined in the program, so a NameError exception is raised.\n",
