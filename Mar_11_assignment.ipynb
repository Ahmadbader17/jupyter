    "To calculate a confidence interval, one must first determine the sample mean, sample size, sample standard deviation, and level of confidence. The confidence interval is then calculated as the sample mean plus or minus the margin of error, which is calculated as the product of the critical value (obtained from a t-distribution or a z-distribution based on the sample size and level of confidence) and the standard error of the mean (calculated as the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size).\n",
