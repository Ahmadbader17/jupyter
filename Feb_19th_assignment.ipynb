    "Flask is a popular Python web framework used for building web applications. It is a micro-framework, which means it provides only the essential features required to build a web application, allowing developers to choose and integrate additional libraries as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of using Flask framework include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for small to medium-sized projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask provides developers with a lot of flexibility and freedom when building web applications, allowing them to choose the components they need to build their app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to get started: Flask is easy to install and set up, making it an ideal choice for beginners who are just starting to learn web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great documentation: Flask has excellent documentation that is easy to follow and understand, making it easy for developers to get help when they need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large community: Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the framework, creating and sharing libraries and tools to make web development faster and easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Flask provides built-in support for testing, making it easy to test and debug applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: Flask can be easily scaled to handle large applications and can be used to build complex web applications."

    "We use app routes in Flask to define the behavior of our web application when a user requests a specific URL. By defining app routes, we can create different pages or views for our application and handle user requests accordingly. This is important because it allows us to build dynamic web applications that can respond to user input and provide relevant content. Additionally, app routes make it easy to organize and maintain large Flask applications by separating different parts of the application into different views or pages."
