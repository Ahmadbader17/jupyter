    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured way, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. Databases can be used to store and manage various types of data such as financial records, customer information, inventory, or any other structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas. These databases use SQL as their standard query language to manage and retrieve data. SQL databases are ideal for handling structured data, which is data that is easily organized into rows and columns. Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of different ways such as key-value pairs, document-oriented databases, graph databases, and column-oriented databases. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not have a predefined schema, making it easier to store and manage unstructured data. NoSQL databases are typically more scalable and can handle large amounts of data more efficiently than SQL databases. Some examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases largely depends on the specific requirements of the application. SQL databases are best suited for applications that require high consistency and transactional integrity, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high scalability, performance, and flexibility in handling unstructured data."

    "In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns in a table and it serves as a reference to a specific record in the table. The primary key constraint ensures that no two records in the table have the same key values.\n",

    "In an SQL query, the order of execution of clauses is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
